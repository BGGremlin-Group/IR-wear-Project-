The Flasher Programs do not generate firmware files.

What Flasher Does:
Purpose: Uploads pre-compiled firmware to microcontrollers
 
Flashes existing  .bin ,  .uf2 ,  .hex  files onto hardware
 
Does NOT create firmware - it only moves binaries to devices
Firmware Source Code
 
Purpose: The actual C++ program that runs on the microcontroller
 
Must be compiled using platform-specific toolchains (Arduino IDE, PlatformIO, etc.)
 
Result: Produces the binary files that the Python flasher uses
Why we do not officially provide Binaries
I cannot give you pre-compiled binaries because:
1. 
Hardware Variants: Your ESP32 might be a DevKit v1 or v4, Pico might be original or W, Nano might have old/new bootloader
2. 
Security: You must compile from source to verify no malicious code
3. 
Configuration: Pin assignments might differ on your boards
4. 
Trust: Only compile firmware you have reviewed
