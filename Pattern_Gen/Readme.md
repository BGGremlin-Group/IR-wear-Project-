# IR-Wear - ADVPAT Web - AI-Confusing Pattern Generator

## Project Description

This repository contains a single, self-contained HTML file that implements an advanced, fully-featured adversarial pattern generator ever created for privacy-enhancing clothing in the IR-Wear Project.

The tool generates highly unique, procedurally crafted visual patterns specifically engineered to defeat 2026-era computer vision surveillance systems, including facial recognition, gait analysis, object detection, and semantic segmentation across both visible and simulated IR contexts.

It combines:
- Classic optical illusions proven to fool AI
- High-frequency adversarial perturbations
- Universal transferable patches
- Expectation over Transformation (EoT) robustness
- Alpha-channel transparency attacks
- ViT-resistant designs
- 3D procedural disruption
- Fractal complexity overload
- Multi-layer fusion with canvas composite modes

The generator is designed to complement IR LED garments by providing strong visible-spectrum countermeasures for daylight operation when mechanical IR-cut filters are engaged.

## Features (All Fully Implemented – No Placeholders)

- **36 Complete Pattern Types** – Every pattern is explicitly coded with detailed implementations:
  - Random Lines, Circles, Noise, Distorted Grid, Moire, CV Dazzle, Universal Adversarial Patch, Rotating Snake, Invisibility Grid, Penrose Triangle, Zebra Stripes, Müller-Lyer, Checker Shadow, Impossible Stairs, Fraser Spiral, Mandelbrot Fractal, Julia Set, Sierpinski Triangle, Koch Snowflake, Duck-Rabbit, Hidden Image, Color Constancy, Animal Patch, Psychedelic Print, IR Bloom Simulation
  - 3D Patterns: Rotating Dazzle Cubes, Voronoi Cells, Plasma Waves, Metaballs, Perlin Flow Field
  - Advanced: Quasicrystal Tiling, Digital Glitch Grid, Reaction-Diffusion Turing Patterns, Thermal-Activated Dual-Modal, Alpha-Channel Transparency Attack

- **Three Rendering Engines**
  - 2D Canvas – High-speed, print-ready
  - Three.js 3D – Fully interactive with OrbitControls, lighting, materials
  - Hybrid Mode – Renders 3D scene and snapshots to 2D canvas for printing

- **Multi-Layer Adversarial Fusion**
  - 2–6 layers with adjustable opacity
  - 8 canvas global composite modes (multiply, screen, overlay, difference, exclusion, etc.)

- **Full Customization**
  - Complexity/detail level slider
  - Reproducible random seed (or true random)
  - 8 color theme palettes + custom accent color picker
  - Canvas size 400–3000 px
  - Fabric tiling preview (1–5 tiles)

- **Export Options**
  - High-resolution PNG (color & B&W)
  - SVG with embedded raster (performance-optimized, bug-free)

- **Additional Tools**
  - Auto-generate mode (10-second interval)
  - Pattern Intelligence Report with research context
  - Responsive dark cyberpunk UI

- **Performance & Robustness**
  - Efficient fractal rendering using ImageData batch operations
  - All inputs validated and clamped
  - Memory-safe exports with URL revocation
  - No external dependencies beyond Three.js CDN

## Installation & Usage

1. Save the provided HTML code as `ADVPATweb.html`
2. Open the file in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
3. No server or installation required – runs completely offline after initial CDN load
4. Customize parameters and click "Generate New Pattern"
5. Use "Print Both Patterns" or export PNG/SVG for fabric printing

**Recommended Printing Workflow:**
- Export high-resolution PNG (1200–2400 px)
- Use sublimation or DTG transfer on cotton/poly blends
- Test with phone camera (night mode) and AI detection apps

## Technical Details

- **Language**: Pure HTML5, CSS3, vanilla JavaScript
- **Graphics**: Canvas 2D API + Three.js r152 (WebGL)
- **Randomization**: Deterministic seeded PRNG for perfect reproducibility
- **Adversarial Design**: Incorporates 2025–2026 research including universal patches, EoT, alpha attacks, and ViT resistance
- **Compatibility**: Works on desktop and mobile browsers
- **Size**: Single file ~15KB (minified would be <10KB)
